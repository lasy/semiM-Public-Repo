abstract = {Objective: We studied self-reported flares before menses in SLE, RA and FM, and determined whether there were differences. Methods: Part 1: women blinded to study hypothesis having menses with SLE and RA completed a 100-day diary logging their pain, fatigue and disease activity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and menses. Part 2: SLE, RA and FM patients were mailed a questionnaire about menstrual cycle and disease changes. Results: Part 1: 28 patients with SLE and 21 with RA were included; 84{\%} of SLE and 71{\%} of RA patients had regular menses. Patients with SLE had higher pain, fatigue and disease activity during menses than in the hormonal surge phase. Patients with RA had increased pain, fatigue and disease activity during decreasing progesterone. Part 2: 498 patients were surveyed, of whom 56{\%} responded (81 SLE, 136 RA and 61 FM). Those taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) ever since diagnosis were 52{\%} with SLE, 41{\%} with RA and 33{\%} with FM (P = 0.1). Those who flared before menses when not on OCP were 36{\%} with SLE, 28{\%} with RA and 54{\%} with FM (P = 0.08). In SLE patients, the mean VAS scores were worse during menses with average scores of 21.0 for pain, 26.7 for fatigue and 18.2 for disease activity vs 16.0 (P = 0.04), 18.6 (P = 0.004) and 11.4 (P = 0.01) during the surge. In RA, the decreasing progesterone phase was different from the increasing oestrogen phase for pain (P = 0.06). Conclusion: There could have been recall bias and participants may have confused pre-menstrual syndrome with flares. However, there seem to be menstrual cycle flares in SLE, RA and FM. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether seizure frequency and cycle days with seizure occurrence vary across the menstrual cycle. The subjects were the first 100 women with intractable focal onset seizures, 13-45 years old, who completed the baseline phase of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Progesterone Trial. Each subject recorded seizures and menses during a 3-month baseline phase. Data consisted of (1) seizure numbers for each cycle day and (2) cycle days with seizure occurrence. Statistical comparisons of seizure frequency and days with seizures were performed using generalized estimating equation one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression followed by pairwise multiple comparisons of days based on the least square means. Seizure numbers and cycle days with seizure occurrence varied across the menstrual cycle. There was an approximately twofold difference between the highest (day 1) and lowest (day -8) values for both seizure frequency and days with occurrence. The demonstration of variation in seizure frequency and cycle days with seizure occurrence across the menstrual cycle, as well as identification of specific days that have substantially higher or lower frequencies than other days, supports the existence of catamenial epilepsy.},

abstract = {Healthy women at reproductive age experience a cyclical alteration of gastrointestinal (GI) symptomatology during their menstrual cycle. Additionally, the majority of healthy women also complain of worsening of GI symptoms either during the premenstrual or menstrual phase. Despite conflicting evidence, studies suggest that sex hormones may increase GI transit time during the luteal phase. Similar phenomenon is also observed in women with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The mechanism underlying this complex pathophysiology is still not completely understood. However, a possible influence of sex hormones on the brain-gut-microbiota axis is hypothesized. The diagnosis of IBD is associated with a delay in menarche as well as menstrual function irregularities including alterations in cycle length and the duration of flow. There is little data on the effect of menopause on IBD disease activity and conflicting data on the effect of IBD diagnosis on the onset of menopause. The role of contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies on the development or disease activity of IBD has not been yet established. Moreover, IBD patients with concomitant dysmenorrhea report heightened pain during menses. The effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in treating primary dysmenorrhea on the disease course of IBD is unknown. In addition, the effect of IBD medications including immunomodulators and biologics on menstrual function remains unclear. Also, the role of IBD surgery on menstrual irregularities needs to be fully elucidated. Hence, understanding the influence of menstrual function on IBD disease activity and vice versa and the maintenance of normal menstrual function in those patients is important in improving overall reproductive health and fertility and outcome of IBD.},

abstract = {A bulk of literature demonstrated that respiratory allergy, and especially asthma, is prevalent in males during childhood, while it becomes more frequent in females from adolescence, i.e., after menarche, to adulthood. The mechanisms underlying the difference between females and males are the effects on the immune response of female hormones and in particular the modulation of inflammatory response by estrogens, as well as the result of the activity of various cells, such as dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, Th1, Th2, T regulatory (Treg) and B regulatory (Bregs) cells, and a number of proteins and cytokines, which include interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13. As far as sexual dimorphism is concerned, a gender difference in the expression profiles of histamine receptors and of mast cells was demonstrated in experimental studies. A critical phase of hormone production is the menstrual cycle, which often is associated with asthma deterioration, as assessed by worsening of clinical symptoms and increase of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In asthmatic woman, there is a high risk to develop more severe asthma during menstruation. The higher prevalence of asthma in females is confirmed also in the post-menopause age, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. In pregnancy, asthma may worsen but may also improve or remain unchanged, with no significant difference in frequency of these three outcomes. For allergic rhinitis, the available studies indicate, likewise asthma, a male predominance in prevalence in childhood that shifts to a female predominance in adolescence and adulthood, but further investigation is needed.},

abstract = {Objectives: Several lines of research suggest that reproductive events may affect the course of bipolar disorder (BD) in some women. With respect to the menstrual cycle, the focus has been on dysphoric symptoms [e.g., premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)], and the exacerbation of depression, in the premenstrual phase. This article reviews the literature on the potential effects of the menstrual cycle on BD. Methods: A systematic search for published case reports and research studies available through March, 2013 was conducted. Several combinations of search terms were entered into PubMed and PsycInfo. Results: Overall, 25 case reports, ten retrospective studies, and 11 prospective studies were identified. The majority (64{\%}) of case reports involved hypomanic or manic episodes in the premenstrual phase. Retrospective results suggest that 25-77{\%} and 15-27{\%} of women with BD meet the criteria for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and PMDD, respectively. Menstrual cycle-related mood changes were reported by 64-68{\%} of women with BD in retrospective studies, and were displayed by 44-65{\%} of women in prospective studies. Conclusions: Although research has focused on the premenstrual phase to the neglect of the periovulatory phase, it appears that a subgroup of women with BD, possibly those with hormonal sensitivity, experience menstrual cycle effects on depressive, hypomanic, and manic episodes. These phase-episode effects appear to be heterogeneous and may have implications for treatment. Whether they might best be described using course specifiers, similar to postpartum onset and rapid cycling, or as diagnostic entities, like PMDD, requires further study. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.

abstract = {This article addresses the estimation of hidden semi-Markov chains from nonstationary discrete sequences. Hidden semi-Markov chains are particularly useful to model the succession of homogeneous zones or segments along sequences. A discrete hidden semi-Markov chain is composed of a nonobservable state process, which is a semi-Markov chain, and a discrete output process. Hidden semi-Markov chains generalize hidden Markov chains and enable the modeling of various durational structures. From an algorithmic point of view, a new forward-backward algorithm is proposed whose complexity is similar to that of the Viterbi algorithm in terms of sequence length (quadratic in the worst case in time and linear in space). This opens the way to the maximum likelihood estimation of hidden semi-Markov chains from long sequences. This statistical modeling approach is illustrated by the analysis of branching and flowering patterns in plants.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

Markov models are often considered even if semi-Markov are better adapted in various situations. Such models are still not frequently applied mainly due to lack of available software. We have developed the R package SemiMarkov to fit homogeneous semi-Markov models to longitudinal data. The package performs maximum likelihood estimation in a parametric framework where the distributions of the sojourn times can be chosen between exponential, Weibull or exponentiated Weibull. The package computes and displays the hazard rates of sojourn times and the hazard rates of the semi-Markov process. The effects of covariates can be studied with a Cox proportional hazards model for the sojourn times distributions. The number of covariates and the distribution of sojourn times can be specified for each possible transition providing a great exibility in a model's definition. This article presents parametric semi-Markov models and gives a detailed description of the package together with an application to asthma control.},

Previous datasets have been collected via carefully curated medical studies, but the recent growth of women's health tracking mobile apps offers potential for reaching a much broader population. However, the feasibility of predicting pregnancy from mobile health tracking data is unclear. Here we develop four models - a logistic regression model, and 3 LSTM models - to predict a woman's probability of becoming pregnant using data from a women's health tracking app, Clue by BioWink GmbH. Evaluating our models on a dataset of 79 million logs from 65,276 women with ground truth pregnancy test data, we show that our predicted pregnancy probabilities meaningfully stratify women: women in the top 10{\%} of predicted probabilities have a 89{\%} chance of becoming pregnant over 6 menstrual cycles, as compared to a 27{\%} chance for women in the bottom 10{\%}. We develop a technique for extracting interpretable time trends from our deep learning models, and show these trends are consistent with previous fertility research. Our findings illustrate the potential that women's health tracking data offers for predicting pregnancy on a broader population; we conclude by discussing the steps needed to fulfill this potential.},

abstract = {Sex and gender differences in disease prevalence, pathogenesis and modulation have been frequently reported. The menstrual cycle represents the opportunity to study the physiological effect of hormonal fluctuations in vivo on the immune function and chronic disease modulation. Reports on the effect of the cycle on immune cell numbers and activity fluctuations are scarce, but recent publications demonstrate an increasing interest in the subject. The menstrual cycle might affect immune cell numbers and modulate their activity throughout the 4-week cycle, as demonstrated in the case of regulatory T cells. The implications of these fluctuations are particularly relevant in the field of chronic diseases affecting women of reproductive age. In fact, baseline inflammation and immune cell activation in association with other mechanisms, such as regulation of receptor expression, modulation of muscular contraction and behavioral aspects might explain the menstrual-associated fluctuations described in chronic and acute diseases. In the following review the current knowledge about the modulatory effects of the menstrual cycle on both immune cells and systemic diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, asthma, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia and schizophrenia, is reported. Most of these diseases display worsening of symptoms premenstrually or during menses due to physiologic effects on the target tissue mediated by progesterone and estrogen fluctuations and, thus, display paradigmatic changes potentially relevant to numerous other conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The use of apps that record detailed menstrual cycle data presents a new opportunity to study the menstrual cycle. The aim of this study is to describe menstrual cycle characteristics observed from a large database of cycles collected through an app and investigate associations of menstrual cycle characteristics with cycle length, age and body mass index (BMI). Menstrual cycle parameters, including menstruation, basal body temperature (BBT) and luteinising hormone (LH) tests as well as age and BMI were collected anonymously from real-world users of the Natural Cycles app. We analysed 612,613 ovulatory cycles with a mean length of 29.3 days from 124,648 users. The mean follicular phase length was 16.9 days (95{\%} CI: 10–30) and mean luteal phase length was 12.4 days (95{\%} CI: 7–17). Mean cycle length decreased by 0.18 days (95{\%} CI: 0.17–0.18, R2 = 0.99) and mean follicular phase length decreased by 0.19 days (95{\%} CI: 0.19–0.20, R2 = 0.99) per year of age from 25 to 45 years. Mean variation of cycle length per woman was 0.4 days or 14{\%} higher in women with a BMI of over 35 relative to women with a BMI of 18.5–25. This analysis details variations in menstrual cycle characteristics that are not widely known yet have significant implications for health and well-being. Clinically, women who wish to plan a pregnancy need to have intercourse on their fertile days. In order to identify the fertile period it is important to track physiological parameters such as basal body temperature and not just cycle length.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the validity of self-reported fertility data generated by a mobile application–based cohort in comparison with data collected by traditional clinical methodologies. Design: Data were collected from July 2013 to July 2018 through a mobile application designed to track fertility. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to assess day-specific pregnancy probabilities. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate differences in day of ovulation and lengths of menstrual phases and to assess changes in the cervix and ovulation-related symptoms drawing closer to the day of ovulation. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Data consisted of 225,596 menstrual cycles from 98,903 women. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Day-specific probabilities of pregnancy, variability in lengths of the follicular and luteal phases, trends in prevalence of symptoms and cervix changes across the fertile window. Result(s): Analyses were consistent with established clinical knowledge. Probability of conception was highest during the 5 days before and day of ovulation, with the highest probability occurring the day before ovulation. The average cycle length was 29.6 days, and average lengths of the follicular and luteal phases were 15.8 and 13.7 days, respectively. Closer to day of ovulation, women were more likely to report changes in the cervix corresponding to fluid consistency, feel, position, and openness and symptoms associated with ovulation, including pelvic pain, tender breasts, increased sex drive, and cramps. Conclusion(s): Components of the menstrual cycle and fertile window, when re-evaluated with a mobile application–based cohort, were found to be consistent with established clinical knowledge, suggesting an agreement between traditional and modern data collection methodologies.},

abstract = {The menstrual cycle is a key indicator of overall health for women of reproductive age. Previously, the study of women's menstruation was done primarily through survey results; however, as mobile apps for menstrual tracking become more widely adopted, they provide an increasingly large, content-rich source of menstrual health experiences and behaviors over time. In this paper, we show that self-reported data from menstrual trackers can reveal statistically significant relationships between per-person variability of cycle length and self-reported qualitative symptoms. Specifically, we explore a database collected using the Clue app by Biowink GmbH of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million natural cycles of user-tracked observations across a wide range of categories to better understand variation of menstrual experience within and across individuals. A concern for self-tracked data is that these reflect not only physiological behaviors, but also the engagement dynamics of app users. We mitigate such potential artifacts by developing a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing us to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We find that women located at different ends of the spectrum of menstrual patterns, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit statistically significant differences in cycle characteristics and symptom tracking. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal, high-resolution self-tracked data for an improved understanding of menstruation and women's health as a whole.},

abstract = {For most women of reproductive age, assessing menstrual health and fertility usually involves regular visits to a gynecologist or another clinician. While these exams provide critical information on an individual's reproductive health status, they typically rely on personal memory, and the results are rarely, if ever, assessed at the population level. In recent years, mobile apps for menstrual tracking have become very popular, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy, reliability and tracking frequency of millions of self-observations, thereby providing an unparalleled view, both in detail and scale, on menstrual health and its evolution. We acquired self-observation data from two mobile apps dedicated to the application of the sympto-thermal fertility awareness method, resulting in a dataset of more than 30 million days of observations from over 2.7 million cycles, where up to 40{\%} of the cycles in which users were seeking pregnancy had recordings every single day. We used a statistical and modeling approach to describe the collected data, investigate ovulation timing and to detect users who presented irregular menstrual patterns. We found that only 24{\%} of ovulations occur at days 14 to 15, that {\~{}}20{\%} of luteal phases last for only 10 days or shorter, and that pre-menstrual light bleeding that is not reported as menses by users is associated with earlier temperature drop in the late luteal phase. The digital epidemiology approach presented here can help to lead to a better understanding of menstrual health and its connection to women's health overall, which has historically been severely understudied.},

This article builds on concepts previously presented, which include the abandonment of long-used, ill-defined, and confusing English-language terms of Latin and Greek origin, such as menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. The term dysfunctional uterine bleeding should also be discarded. Alternative terms and concepts have been proposed and defined. The terminologies and definitions described here have been comprehensively reviewed and have received wide acceptance as a basis both for routine clinical practice and for comparative research studies.

abstract = {As an extension to the popular hidden Markov model (HMM), a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) allows the underlying stochastic process to be a semi-Markov chain. Each state has variable duration and a number of observations being produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use in a wider range of applications. Its forward-backward algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of the underlying stochastic process. Since the HSMM was initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis, human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting recognition, functional MRI brain mapping, and network anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers published in the literature. An overview of HSMMs is presented in this paper, including modelling, inference, estimation, implementation and applications. It first provides a unified description of various HSMMs and discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary conditions of HSMM are extended. Then the conventional models, including the explicit duration, variable transition, and residential time of HSMM, are discussed. Various duration distributions and observation models are presented. Finally, the paper draws an outline of the applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Introduction: Little is known about the occurrence and patterns of vaginal bleeding during the earliest stages of pregnancy. We explore this in a prospective study of early pregnancy. Methods: A total of 221 healthy women kept daily diaries and provided daily urine samples while trying to become pregnant. Of these, 151 women became clinically pregnant [i.e. pregnancy that lasted {\textgreater}6 weeks beyond last menstrual period (LMP)] during the study. Diaries provided information on days with vaginal bleeding and sexual intercourse. Urine hormone assays were used to identify ovulation and implantation. Women were interviewed about their medical histories and lifestyle factors. Results: A total of 14 women (9{\%}) recorded at least 1 day of vaginal bleeding during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. Twelve of these 14 pregnancies continued to a live birth. Bleeding tended to occur around the time when women would expect their periods, although rarely on the day of implantation. Bleeding was not associated with intercourse. Conclusions: Early bleeding in clinical pregnancies is generally light, and not likely to be mistaken for LMP. Thus, early bleeding is unlikely to contribute to errors in LMP-based gestational age. We found no support for the hypothesis that implantation can produce vaginal bleeding. Similarly, intercourse did not cause bleeding. Nearly all women with bleeding went on to have successful pregnancies.},

abstract = {Background and objectives The underlying reasons why some women experience debilitating premenstrual symptoms and others do not are largely unknown. Here, we test the evolutionary ecological hypothesis that some negative premenstrual symptoms may be exacerbated by the presence of chronic sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methodology 34 511 women were recruited through a digital period-tracker app. Participants were asked: (i) Have you ever been diagnosed with a STI? (ii) If yes, when was it, and were you given treatment? Those data were combined with longitudinal cycle data on menstrual bleeding patterns, the experience of pain and emotions and hormonal contraceptive use. Results 865 women had at least two complete menstrual cycle data and were eligible for analysis. Before diagnosis, the presence of an infection predicts a ca. 2-fold increase in the odds of reporting both headache, cramps and sadness during the late luteal phase and sensitive emotions during the wider luteal phase. After diagnosis, the odds of reporting negative symptoms pre-menstrually remain unchanged among STI negative individuals, but the odds of reporting sensitive emotions decrease among STI positive individuals receiving a treatment. No relationships between STIs, pain and emotions are observed among hormonal contraceptive users. Conclusions and implications The results support the idea that a negative premenstrual experience might be aggravated by the presence of undiagnosed STIs, a leading cause of infertility worldwide. Caution is warranted in extrapolating the results as the data are self-reported, inflammatory levels are unknown and the tracker is biased towards recording negative premenstrual symptoms among Western individuals.},

abstract = {Cycles are fundamental to human health and behavior. However, modeling cycles in time series data is challenging because in most cases the cycles are not labeled or directly observed and need to be inferred from measurements taken over time. Here, we present Cyclic Hidden Markov Models (CyHMMs) for detecting and modeling cycles in a collection of multidimensional heterogeneous time series data. In contrast to previous cycle modeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in modeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with both discrete and continuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data; and they can share information across individuals to accommodate variation both within and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic and real-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths more accurately than existing methods, with 58{\%} lower error on simulated data and 63{\%} lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing baseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can model the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the cycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series into groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world health-tracking datasets -- of human menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity tracking data -- yields important insights including which symptoms to expect at each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several groups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along dimensions not provided to the model. For example, by modeling missing data in the menstrual cycles dataset, we are able to discover a medically relevant group of birth control users even though information on birth control is not given to the model.},

The data for human subjects was based on a group of 23 normal women scheduled for surgical sterilization. Blood was drawn daily between 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. beginning on day 10 of the cycle. Surgery was performed 1 to 5 days after the LH peak. The hormonal findings were correlated with the histology of the corpus luteum.

Secretions of progesterone and estrogen again are characteristic of the lutea! phase ending with menstruation. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormones are detectable just before the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone surges. Basal body temperature rises with ovulation and is still the most reliable clinical indicator, although ferning and spinnbarkeit (when present) are also quite helpful.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intercourse results in a pregnancy essentially only if it occurs during the 6-day fertile interval ending on the day of ovulation. The strong association between timing of intercourse within this interval and the probability of conception typically is attributed to limited sperm and egg life times. METHODS: A total of 782 women recruited from natural family planning centres in Europe contributed prospective data on 7288 menstrual cycles. Daily records of intercourse, basal body temperature and vaginal discharge of cervical mucus were collected. Probabilities of conception were estimated according to the timing of intercourse relative to ovulation and a 1-4 score of mucus quality. RESULTS: There was a strong increasing trend in the day-specific probabilities of pregnancy with increases in the mucus score. Adjusting for the mucus score, the day-specific probabilities had limited variability across the fertile interval. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in mucus quality across the fertile interval predict the observed pattern in the day-specific probabilities of conception. To maximize the likelihood of conception, intercourse should occur on days with optimal mucus quality, as observed in vaginal discharge, regardless of the exact timing relative to ovulation.},

abstract = {Paired daily blood and urine samples were collected from 10 apparently healthy premenopausal women to compare the hormone profiles of estradiol (E2) and progesterone in serum with those of estrone conjugates (E1Conj) and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG) in urine. Serum hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits, whereas the urinary steroid metabolites were assessed by both HLA and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RIA and EIA values for urinary E1Conj and PdG were not different, and both methods produced urinary profiles that paralleled the profile of the parent steroid in serum. However, the simplicity, flexibility, and economy of EIA will make this method more widely applicable. Mean E1Conj values lagged behind concentrations of serum E2 by one day or less, whereas daily urinary PdC profiles lagged behind serum progesterone by one to two days. Mean urinary profiles of E1Conj were similar whether or not creatinine was used to adjust for urine volume; however, creatinine indexing was beneficial when urinary profiles in individual cycles were compared with changes of serum E2.},

@article{Cole2009,
abstract = {Objective: To address conflicts in the normal variabilities of the menstrual cycle using the newest generation test methods and to establish normal ranges for use in clinical practice. Design: Daily urine samples were collected from 167 women eager to achieve pregnancy. Samples were tested prospectively for LH and total hCG. A total of 458 nongestational and 111 gestational menstrual cycles were evaluated. Setting: Division of Women's Health Research, University of New Mexico. Patient(s): One hundred sixty-seven women desiring pregnancy. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Levels of hCG and LH. Result(s): Menstrual cycles were 27.7 ± 2.4 days in length. The LH peak indicated the onset of the presumed ovulatory window, which occurs at 14.7 ± 2.4 days. Implantation (first day of sensitive detection of hCG) occurred in gestational menstrual cycles at 24.6 ± 3.1 days, or 4.3 ± 2.2 days before missing the expected onset of menses. Conclusion(s): Our data confirm epidemiological studies on menstrual cycle length and variability and hormonal studies on timing of the ovulatory window and its variability. They dispute, however, the published data on the timing and variance of implantation. As shown, implantation is limited to a 10-day interval culminating in the day of the expected onset of menses. Reference range data provide guidelines for differentiating normal and problem menstrual cycles. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.},

@article{Malcolm2003,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anovulation exists in normally menstruating women. METHODS: In a database of 550 consecutive couples seeking pregnancy, results of the midluteal serum progesterone level analysis planned for 7 days before the onset of the next menses were examined in women with predictable cycles shorter than 35 days. RESULTS: Of the 550 couples seeking pregnancy, 410 of the female partners (74.5{\%}) were eumenorrheic. Fifteen of these women (3.7{\%}) had apparently anovulatory cycles with a progesterone lower than the normal ovulatory value of 15 nmol/L. Further examination showed that four of the 15 women (26.7{\%}) had an isolated prolonged cycle, whereas an additional four (26.7{\%}) failed to have their sample taken at an appropriate time. One (6.7{\%}) had a low progesterone level that was normal in the subsequent cycle. Two patients (13.3{\%}) were older than 40, both having elevated early follicular follicle-stimulating hormone levels. One patient (6.7{\%}) conceived in the following menstrual cycle without further evaluation. The three remaining women (20{\%}) showed consistently apparently anovulatory cycles. However, the levels were exclusively above the follicular range. CONCLUSION: Our findings cast doubt on the concept of anovulatory cycles in eumenorrheic women and suggest that further examination of the lower level of ovulatory progesterone may indeed be necessary. {\textcopyright} 2003 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

There is a medical/cultural expectation that clinically normal menstrual cycles are inevitably ovulatory. Currently within the general population it is unknown the proportion of regular, normal-length menstrual cycles that are ovulatory. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the population point prevalence of ovulation in premenopausal, normally menstruating women. The null hypothesis was that such cycles are ovulatory. Methods: This is a single-cycle, cross-sectional, population-based study-a sub-study of the HUNT3 health study in the semi-rural county (Nord Tr{\o}ndelag) in mid-Norway. Participants included {\textgreater}3,700 spontaneously (no hormonal contraception) menstruating women, primarily Caucasian, ages 20-49.9 from that county. Participation rate was 51.9{\%}. All reported the date previous flow started. A single, random serum progesterone level was considered ovulatory if ≥9.54 nmol/L on cycle days 14 to -3 days before usual cycle length (CL). Results: Ovulation was assessed in 3,168 women mean age 41.7 (interquartile range, [IQR] 36.8 to 45.5), cycle length 28 days (d) (IQR 28 to 28) and body mass index (BMI) 26.3 kg/m2 (95{\%} CI 26.1 to 26.4). Parity was 95.6{\%}, 30{\%} smoked, 61.3{\%} exercised regularly and 18{\%} were obese. 1,545 women with a serum progesterone level on cycle days 14 to -3 were presumed to be in the luteal phase. Of these, 63.3{\%} of women had an ovulatory cycle (n = 978) and 37{\%} (n = 567) were anovulatory. Women with/without ovulation did not differ in age, BMI, cycle day, menarche age, cigarette use, physical activity, {\%} obesity or self-reported health. There were minimal differences in parity (96.7{\%} vs. 94.5{\%}, P = 0.04) and major differences in progesterone level (24.5 vs. 3.8 nmol/L, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Anovulation in a random population occurs in over a third of clinically normal menstrual cycles.},

@article{Wilcox1999,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Implantation of the conceptus is a key step in pregnancy, but little is known about the time of implantation or the relation between the time of implantation and the outcome of pregnancy. METHODS: We collected daily urine samples for up to six months from 221 women attempting to conceive after ceasing to use contraception. Ovulation was identified on the basis of the ratio of urinary estrogen metabolites to progesterone metabolites, which changes rapidly with luteinization of the ovarian follicle. The time of implantation was defined by the appearance of chorionic gonadotropin in maternal urine. RESULTS: There were 199 conceptions, for 95 percent of which (189) we had sufficient data for analysis. Of these 189 pregnancies, 141 (75 percent) lasted at least six weeks past the last menstrual period, and the remaining 48 pregnancies (25 percent) ended in early loss. Among the pregnancies that lasted six weeks or more, the first appearance of chorionic gonadotropin occurred 6 to 12 days after ovulation; 118 women (84 percent) had implantation on day 8, 9, or 10. The risk of early pregnancy loss increased with later implantation (P{\textless}0.001). Among the 102 conceptuses that implanted by the ninth day, 13 percent ended in early loss. This proportion rose to 26 percent with implantation on day 10, to 52 percent on day 11, and to 82 percent after day 11. CONCLUSIONS: In most successful human pregnancies, the conceptus implants 8 to 10 days after ovulation. The risk of early pregnancy loss increases with later implantation.},

abstract = {Published 2017. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA Background: Pregnancy loss can have physical and psychological consequences for women and their families. Though a previous study described an increase in the risk of self-reported pregnancy loss from 1970 to 2000, more recent examinations from population-based data of US women are lacking. Methods: We used data from the 1995, 2002, 2006–2010, 2011–2015 National Survey of Family Growth on self-reported pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) among US women (15–44 years) who reported at least one pregnancy conceived during 1990–2011 that did not result in induced termination (n = 20 012 women; n = 42 526 pregnancies). Trends in the risk of self-reported pregnancy loss and early pregnancy loss ({\textless}12 weeks) were estimated, separately, by year of pregnancy conception (limited to 1990–2011 to ensure a sufficient sample of pregnancies for each year and maternal age group) using log-Binomial and Poisson models, adjusted for maternal- and pregnancy-related factors. Results: Among all self-reported pregnancies, excluding induced terminations, the risk of pregnancy loss was 19.7{\%} and early pregnancy loss was 13.5{\%} during 1990–2011. Risk of pregnancy loss increased by a relative 2{\%} (rate ratio [RR] 1.02, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 1.02) per year in unadjusted models and 1{\%} per year (RR 1.01, 95{\%} CI 1.00, 1.02) during 1990–2011, after adjustment for maternal characteristics and pregnancy-related factors. In general, trends were similar for early pregnancy loss. Conclusion: From 1990 to 2011, risk of self-reported pregnancy loss increased among US women. Further work is needed to better understand the drivers of this increase in reported pregnancy loss in the US.},

About one half of cases of early pregnancy loss are caused by a random event in which the embryo receives an abnormal number of chromosomes. Chromosomes are the structures inside cells that carry genes. Most cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. Sperm and egg cells each have 23 chromosomes. During fertilization, when the egg and sperm join, the two sets of chromosomes come together. If an egg or sperm has an abnormal number of chromosomes, the embryo also will have an abnormal number.

Countries with high preterm birth rates are more likely to have high early term birth rates; many risk factors are shared, including pregnancy complications (hypertension, diabetes), medical practices (provider-initiated delivery, assisted reproduction), maternal socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics and environmental factors. Exceptions include nulliparity and inflammation which increase risks for preterm, but not early term birth. Birth before 39 weeks GA is associated with adverse child health outcomes across a wide range of settings. International rate variations suggest that reductions in early delivery are achievable; implementation of best practice guidelines for obstetrical interventions and public health policies targeting population risk factors could contribute to prevention of both late preterm and early term births.},
