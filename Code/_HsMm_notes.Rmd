# Notes

## TO DO

- Data pre-processing:

    + [DONE] re-run so that rel_date exists for all users 

- Manual labelling:

    + [DONE] option to delete labels (and delete pregnancy in af3d...)
    
    + [DONE] check that the labels do not overlap (overwrite)
    
    + label __more__ time-series
    
    
- Model specification:

    + [DONE] MODIFY the model: Make the transition to Anovulatory cycle direct from Menses-- [done] (and maybe? remove the state "Loss" as PL can directly transition to Menses)
    

- Decoding:

    + [DONE] After decoding, check the probability of the observations given the decoded state in order to provide a confidence score for each time-point (or state)
    
    + [DONE] Modify the code so that the end-user provides a matrix of observations with NAs instead of having to provide an observation matrix WITH a censoring matrix
    
    + [DONE]Keep a static viz of the decoded time-series in the Rmd (large width)
    
    + UNDERSTAND WHY VITERBI is so BAD?!



- Observation transformation for the semi-Markov

    + [DONE] -- set the mucus to NA when bleeding >= light --
    
    + [DONE] -- remove temperature outliers --
    
    + [DONE] set the temperature to NA when bleeding == heavy
    
    + ?? normalize the mucus on a per user basis
